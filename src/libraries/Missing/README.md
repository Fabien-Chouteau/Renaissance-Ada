# Missing Functionality of Libraries used by Renaissance-Ada

Renaissance-Ada uses a number of external libraries.
Renaissance-Ada occasionally would like to extend some of these external libraries.
The desired extensions are codified in this Missing library,
as long as the changed request is not accepted by the external library.

For illustration of this process, see [Missing Value Function of SLOC](https://github.com/AdaCore/langkit/issues/492).
The functions shown in this issue were part of Missing.LangKit 
until the version of [LangKit](https://github.com/AdaCore/langkit) 
used by Renaissance-Ada provided the desired functionality.
